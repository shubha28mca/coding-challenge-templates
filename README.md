# coding-challenge-templates
This is simple template code for writting fast code while attening the online coding challenge and doing some POC for your current job.
we can enhance the template to many of the small problem to solve and also this will coves below contents.
1. Basic data structure how to use them. (Array, List, Tree, Graph, Hash, Tries, stack, queue, heap)
2. Basic algorithms (BFS, DFS, A * search, sorting)
3. Common problems, that already solved.
4. Along with this we will try to solve some of the biggest problems in computer science. (performance, optimisation )

We are not insiting someone, to just copy the code. But you can refer and add your business logic according to your need.
